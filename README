Docu is a code documentation tool. It is planned to support many different programming languages.
It stores all of its documentation in a database, and the documentation is viewed dynamically. This is
so that cool features like search can be created. Search was the main reason for the creation of docu.


INSTALLATION

Installation currently is quite manual, but it is simple.

1. Put all of the files in the src/ directory somewhere accessable by your web server.

2. Create a MySQL database for docu, and grant your user ALL access.

3. Change src/processor/config.php and src/viewer/config.php to match your database details.

4. Run the src/processor/database_layout_sync.php tool. This tool should create your database layout.
   If you update your version of docu, just run this tool again to get the new layout.

5. Run src/processor/main.php to generate your documentation.
   Re-run the tool every time your code changes.

6. View the documentation using the viewer directory (e.g. http://www.example.com/docs/viewer)
