Pelzini is split into two parts:

<b>The processor</b>
The processor does all of the actual thinking for Pelzini. It does the code parsing, and loads the
parsed documentation into one or more outputtters.

Outputters are currently the three databases, but other outputters are planned for future versions.

<b>The viewer</b>
The viewer allows for the viewing of database-driven documentation. It is specifically coded in a 'dumb' way,
it makes no assumptions for anything and relies entierly on the database.

This design allows the processor and the viewer to be physically located in different locations on the
computer, or evne on different computers entirely.
